### CBTP Project Overview
Our system has three main dashboards:

1. Admin Dashboard

2. Staff Dashboard

3. Users Dashboard

This is the final version of our CBTP project. You can import the database and test it yourself�everything is fully functional on our website.
If you have any questions about how it works, feel free to reach out to me anytime.

How the System Works
## 1. Application Request

Residents submit requests for either a Certificate or a Residence ID.

## 2. Admin/Staff Notification & Review

The Admin/Staff receives a notification in the "Manage Request" sidebar menu, indicating a new application request.

They review the request and verify whether the applicant exists in the residents' list by checking the house number.

Based on the verification result, the Admin/Staff accepts or rejects the application.

3. Applicant Notification

Once the application is processed, the applicant receives a notification in their "Application Checker" sidebar.

If accepted, they can proceed to the next step to obtain their Certificate or Residence ID, depending on their request.

4. Document Generation

Approved applicants can download and print their Certificate or Residence ID in PDF format.

### Note: The system is not fully functional yet, so you'll need to work on the missing components to complete it. 
This project will serve as a portfolio piece for your internship application to help you get accepted. 
If you have any doubts, feel free to contact me anytime. However, I encourage all of you to work on it 
as much as possible to develop your skills.
